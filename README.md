# Mesh History
![GIF showing use of addon](sculpt_versions.gif)

Blender add-on to add the functionality to save versions of your mesh. Useful for sculpting when you want to save previous steps or test different ideas. Unlike shape keys, you can delete and remesh to your heart's content. Loading different versions does not affect materials, constraints or modifiers, but does affect vertex positions, groups, material assignment and shape keys. Tested with 2.93.

[Here is an example of how to install an add on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14G_YIVdBd0)

Once installed the tool is available in object mode. Simply click Add -> Armature -> Bendy Bone
